Q1. This is an example of the duplicated code code smell. You can condense the repeated code into
    a method that can be called when that funcionality is desired.

Q3. updateAndTrim() does not belong in the Nodes class. Instead, it should be in the Jenkins class.
    This is an example of feature envy. Moving the method to the Jenkins class eliminates this issue.

Q4. The repeated code can be condensed into one statement by using a for loop to account for the number
    of times it has to be repeated.

Q6. We are refactoring the repeated code on lines 87-98 in .../jenkins/test/src/test/java/hudson/model/RunParameterDefinitionTest.Java
    by using "Extract Local Variable" for each input of the test, then "Extract Method" to simplify the test.
